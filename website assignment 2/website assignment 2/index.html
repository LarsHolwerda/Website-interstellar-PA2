        <h1>The <strong>Interstellar</strong> plot</h1>
        <p>
          In 2067, a global famine caused humanity to abandon scientific
          pursuits such as space exploration. Ex-NASA pilot
          <em>Joseph Cooper</em> is forced to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper
          experiences a gravitational "anomaly" in his daughter Murph's bedroom.
          He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a
          secret NASA facility headed by <em>Professor Brand.</em>
          Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a secret mission to
          discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that he is
          working on a gravity-equation. He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an
          exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists, Romilly, Doyle,
          and Brandâ€™s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on
          board the Endurance to pass through to another galaxy. Their mission
          is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole
          called Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA
          scientist-explorer.
